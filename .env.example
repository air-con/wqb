# =================================================================
# Example Environment Variables for wqb Project
#
# For all services (worker, periodic-service, flower) to start
# reliably, all variables in this file are required.
#
# Why does Flower need all variables?
# Although Flower's main function only needs CELERY_BROKER_URL to
# connect to the message broker, it must load the entire Celery
# application to discover tasks. This loading process touches other
# parts of the code that expect these environment variables to be present.
# Providing dummy values may cause unexpected errors.
# =================================================================


# 1. Celery Configuration
# -----------------------
# [REQUIRED FOR ALL SERVICES] The connection URL for your message broker.
# For Docker Compose, use 'rabbitmq' as the host. For external services, use the actual host.
CELERY_BROKER_URL=amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672//

# [USED BY WORKER] Controls the number of concurrent processes for the main worker.
# The Dockerfile defaults to 3 if this is not set.
CELERY_CONCURRENCY=3


# 2. Lark/Feishu Configuration
# ----------------------------
# [REQUIRED FOR ALL SERVICES TO BOOT] Credentials for the Lark/Feishu API.

LARK_TABLE_ID=your_lark_table_id


# 3. WorldQuant BRAIN (WQB) Configuration
